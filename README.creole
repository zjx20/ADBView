=== Known issues and feature requests ===
Please go [[https://github.com/quarnster/ADBView/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open|here]] to see the currently known issues and feature request, or to file a new.

=== Prerequisites ===
  # The Android SDK should be installed, and ADB should be in your path.
  # If you want to connect to the emulator on Windows, you'll have to [enable telnet](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/910.enabling-telnet-client-in-windows-7-en-us.aspx). See #16.

=== Installation ===
    # The easiest way to install this plugin is via the excellent Package Control Plugin
    ## See http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control#Installation
    ### Once package control has been installed, bring up the command palette (cmd+shift+P or ctrl+shift+P)
    ### Type Install and select "Package Control: Install Package"
    ### Select ADBView from the list. Package Control will keep it automatically updated for you
    ## If you don't want to use package control, you can manually install it
    ### Go to your packages directory and type:
    ####        git clone https://github.com/quarnster/ADBView ADBView
    # The default command is ["adb", "logcat"]. If you want to change this you can do so via the file setting "adb_command"

=== Usage ===
After installation, hit ctrl+alt+d to open up an ADB logcat view.

Message filters can be set by clicking a line in the logcat view and then right click and choose one of the menu options:

    # ADB Filter by Process ID
    # ADB Filter by Process Name
    # ADB Filter by Message Level
    # ADB Filter by Debuggable Apps
    # ADB Custom Regular Expression Filter

Or by selecting some text and then right click and choose one of the menu options:

    # ADB Filter by Containing Selections
    # ADB Filter by Excluding Selections

You can also specify a custom regular expression filter in the preferences or project settings.
